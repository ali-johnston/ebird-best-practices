# Welcome {-}

**This book is currently under active development. Please explore and give us feedback, but be aware that some sections are incomplete and others may still contain bugs.**

**Best Practices for Using eBird Data** is a supplement to *Best practices for making reliable inferences from citizen science data: case study using eBird to estimate species distributions* ([Johnston et al. 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/574392v1)). This paper describes the challenges associated with making inferences from biological citizen science data and proposes a set of best practices for making reliable estimates of species distributions from these data. Throughout, the paper uses [eBird](https://ebird.org/), the world's largest biological citizen science project, as a case study to illustrate the good practices. This book acts as a supplement to the paper, showing readers how to implement these best practices within [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using real data from eBird. After completing this book, readers should be able to extract data from the eBird database suitable for their own studies, process these data to prepare them for robust analyses, collect environmental covariates for modeling, and fit and assess models estimating encounter rate, occupancy, and relative abundance. Readers should be comfortable with the R programming language, and read the [Prerequisites](#intro-pre) and [Setup](#intro-setup) sections of the introduction, before diving into this book.

A preprint of the paper associated with this book is currently [available on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/574392v1).
